# Description: The final thing that the infrastructure does before it is ready for
# use is to write the valid DB credentials to a mounted file system which is shared
# to every machine which needs to access the database. Once a machine has access to this
# file, then, we know that they build process is completed. We write a marker file which
# the build client test for and if it finds it then it knows that the build is complete
# and informs the user that they should now be able to navigate to their website.
