# Description: Most applications have a configuration file in their root directory which contains things
# such as database credentials, database ip address and so on. There are basically some scenarios.
#
# 1) When an application is installed as a virgin, in other words,  the unaltered sourcecode from an
# application provider, for example, joomla or wordpress, then the database credentials are set for this
# application in the script:
#
#        ${HOME}/providerscripts/processing/InitialiseVirginDeployment.sh
#
# also, in this case, it is recorded that the credentials have been set for the new application and this
# script will be ineffective.
#
# 2) When we are installing from a baseline or a backup, then this script is called. There are some conditions
# to be met before it can be run, like is the configuration directory mounted. Once these are met, this script
# runs and sets the database configuration credentials for the application similar to how it is done for the
# virgin install. It does this by calling application specific checks. Because we are not quite sure at what
# point the mounted config directory will be available, we simply run this script from cron every minute.
# In the case when the configuration credentials for the application have been set, this script simply exits.
# As soon as the credentials are successfully set for the application, although this script continues to run
# every minute from cron, it doesn't do anything.
#
# So, basically, 1) the machine is rebooted.
#                2) Every minute after reboot, run this script
#                3) If the credentials haven't been set by either a previous run of this script or the
#                   VirginDeployment script, set the credentials in the applications configuration file
#                   in an application specific way if the credentials have been previously set, simply exit.
#                   We can tell if the credentials have been prviously set by testing for the marker files,
#                   ${HOME}/config/APPLICATION_CONFIGURATION_PREPARED and ${HOME}/runtime/APPLICATION_CONFIGURATION_PREPARED
#                   N.B. We use these different marker files depending upon whether the application requires
#                   that we use a common shared configuration file for all webservers or whether each webserver
#                   instance requires its own configuration file
