# Description: It is important to remember that there can be 1..n webservers
# running and yet they will all want the same SSL certificate.
# If one webserver detects, 'hey shit, the SSL cert is getting low on it's validity'
# then it will generate a new one. We don't want all the other webservers to go off
# and generate their own certificates when one has already setup a fresh new one, so,
# instead, we copy the fresh certificate to our datastore and then each webserver
# can detect it and make it's own copy of it and then start to use it. It is a rare
# event that a cert will be renewed and we check for it at night, the webserver is
# then reloaded to pick up the new certificate.
