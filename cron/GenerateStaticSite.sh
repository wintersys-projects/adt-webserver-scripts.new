# Description: Sometimes if you have a blog or something which doesn't require dynamic interaction from a user
# it might be preferable to generate as static copy of your site and host it in (for example) an S3 bucket
# and have the content served statically to your readers. This has some advantages for some website profiles:
# Its more secure, its cheaper, its faster, and its more resilient (properly set up there should be about zero
# chance of server errors and misconfigurations). What I am doing here is providing a way to generate a static site
# copy to a (for example) S3 bucket based on the dyanmic site you are running and updating. If youa are a blogger,
# therefore, in full flight this system would work by you hosting a private (no public access at all) dynamic site
# that only you (or your team of bloggers) can access and update your blog posts on and to. At a given periodicity
# (perhaps as often as every hour) your private dynamic site can use "GENERATE_STATIC" to generate a static copy
# of your website and uploading it to your, for example, S3 bucket with any changes that have been made to your blogs
# since you last generate a static copy. Using this has the advantages I have outlined. I have used this in a rudimentary
# way I would be interested to see if you can get it to work fully if that is your usecase
